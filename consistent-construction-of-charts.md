# Consistent Construction of Charts

- Adding best practices to common chart
  - Can end up being its own programming languague
     - One user had 200 pg manual on their common chart
- Is it better to do generators?
  - Ask folks some questions and generate the chart
- JSON schema
  - There are challenges with validating that things are the right values. For example non-zero int
- Tooling like lint extensions
  - Something that tests states of the manifests after rendering
  - Similar to [kube-lint](https://github.com/viglesiasce/kube-lint)
  - There is an issue open on the Helm repo to add more to the linter there
- There are things that Helm doesnt support from YAML
  - No anchors
  - YQ is used to get values out of a YAML
    - How we check version increments
- There is a proposal for overlays
  - kfox opened this
  - Can you have a overrides folder to take over resources from dependent charts
- Currently in Charts repo we do conditional deployment of secrets/configmaps based on a value
  - customConfigMap
- One customer has 200 charts and using style guide to make sure people do the right thing
  - Stacknetes approach
  - Internal linters were useful
    - Before and after rendering
  - Charts get developed ad hoc, then the best practices applied later
- Should there be more flexibility in the helm lint
  - Maintainers are looking to add configs for YAML linting
- Templating can be hard for users that donâ€™t know Go template or Go
- Do dev teams want to write charts	
  - Yes at the beginning
  - After a while its too complicated to handle
  - Have to think about a lot of kubernetes "things"
    - RBAC
    - Network policy
